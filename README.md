# Pizza-Ordering-System-Java-FX
A simple GUI implemented using JavaFX features. The package includes a controller class, an illegal entry class, a style sheet, an FXML file and the main classes. Although this was not done in the most efficient manor it is a good example of the different features of the Java programming language.
